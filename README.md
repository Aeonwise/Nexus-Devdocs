# Welcome to Nexus Developer Documentation

## Welcome to Nexus

Nexus is a next-generation blockchain technology that is **re-building the internet** from the ground up.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This is a living document, work in progress and will be updated regularly after completion
{% endhint %}

## Why Nexus?

Nexus is the most advanced, innovative and open protocol blockchain platform in the crypto space. The technology will be able to encompass all the usecases which requires blockchain and smart contracts on a decentralised network.&#x20;

Nexus was mined into existence similar to Bitcoin, there was no ICO or premine which makes it a safe bet against any regulatory crackdown.

{% hint style="info" %}
The development of Nexus is still ongoing and we have a extensive roadmap
{% endhint %}

### Economics

The genesis block of Nexus was mined on September 23rd of 2014 at 16:20:00 GMT â€“ 7.

Nexus has a max supply of 78,000,000 NXS, which will be mined by September, 2024 and after that there will be tail end emission of 3.67% max. Mining will emit 0.67% and staking will emit 3% if all the NXS are staked.

### Nexus Innovations:

1. 7 layer Software Stack
2. Signature Chains
3. Quantum Resistance
4. Register based 64-bit Virtual Machine
5. 3 channel consensus, 2 mining channels Prime, Hash and nPoS based on Trust
6. Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) based on Starfish
7. 3 Dimensional chain (3DC) - Future
8. Decentralised Internet -Future
9. Location identification seperation protocol (LISP) - Future
10. LX-OS - Future

Nexus throughput on Tritium is 655 TPS, and each Tx can hold upto a max 100 contracts. 655\*100=65500 contracts per second theoretical max.

{% hint style="info" %}
Tritium++ throughput has seen a lot of improvements and will be updated with Tritium++ launch
