# Ethereum to Nexus

If you are someone who has experience developing on Ethereum, EVM compatible or other protocol chains and interested in building on Nexus:

* Nexus has a disparate architecture compared to Ethereum and other protocol chains.
* Nexus is a _`Verification`_ engine, unlike Ethereum which is a _`Computation`_ engine.
* Nexus is not EVM compatible.
* Nexus is not interoperable with other chains and we have a very good reason for that.
* Nexus is still under heavy development. Refer to the [roadmap](https://nexus.io/roadmap) for more details.

## How to Build on Nexus

Nexus does not have a smart-contract programming language similar to Ethereum. As said before being a unique architecture; the options to build on Nexus are as below.

### INTEGRATED API

Today development is made possible with the REST API which is a higher level API. This empowers  web developers and even no-code developers to build blockchain applications.
