# ASSETS

{% hint style="warning" %}
This page is still being updated.
{% endhint %}

An asset is a user-defined data structure that is stored in an object register, owned by a particular signature chain. Assets can hold one or more pieces of data and users can define the fields (name, data type, mutability) that data is stored in. The assets API supports the `readonly`, `raw`, `basic` and `JSON` formats and the user is required to specify the format.

The `readonly` and `raw` formats are useful when developers wish to store arbitrary data, without incurring the overhead of defining an object. The value will be provided with the `data` parameter. The `readonly` format cannot be updated and is stored in a readonly register. The `raw` format is stored in a raw register and allows the data to be updated.

The `basic` format allows callers to define an asset in terms of simple key=value pairs. It assumes all values are stored using the string data type. The key=value pairs can be updated.

The `JSON` format allows callers to provide a detailed definition of the supply data structure, with each field defined with a specific data type and mutability. Items defined with one of the complex formats can be updated after their initial creation.

The assets API also provides a history of changes to the values, as well as the history of ownership of the item.

The full supported endpoint of the assets URI is as follows:

```
assets/verb/noun/filter/operator
```

The minimum required components of the URI are:

```
assets/verb/noun
```

## `Supported Verbs`

The following verbs are currently supported by this API command-set:

[`create`](c-assets.md#create) - Generate a new object of supported type.\
[`get`](c-assets.md#get) -  Get object information of supported type.\
[`list`](c-assets.md#list) - List all objects owned by given profile.\
[`update`](c-assets.md#update) - Update an object register.\
[`transfer`](c-assets.md#transfer) - Transfer ownership of an object register.\
[`claim`](c-assets.md#claim) - Claim ownership of an object register.\
[`tokenize`](c-assets.md#claim-1) - To represent ownership of an asset object with a token object.\
[`transactions`](c-assets.md#transactions) - List all transactions that modified specified object.\
[`history`](c-assets.md#history) - Generate the history of all last states.&#x20;

## `Supported Nouns`

The following nouns are supported for this API command-set:

\[`asset`] - An object register containing an asset object.\
\[`raw`] - An object register containing a raw asset object.\
\[`readonly`] - An object register containing a read-only asset object.\
\[`any`] - An object selection noun allowing mixed asset objects.\
\[`schema`] - An object register containing a user-defined asset object.\
\
**Example:**

```
assets/list/asset
```

The above command will list all the assets for a user account.

## `Direct Endpoints`

The following commands are direct endpoints and thus do not support the above `verb` and `noun` structure available above.

``[`list/partial`](c-assets.md#list-partial) -Retrieve information on a tokenised asset.

## `create` <a href="#user-content-create" id="user-content-create"></a>

Create a new object register specified by given noun.

```
assets/create/noun
```

This command supports the `asset`, `readonly`, `raw`, and `any` nouns.

#### create/asset

Creates a new asset in an object register.

#### create/readonly

Creates a new asset in an readonly register.

#### create/raw

Creates a new asset in a raw register.

#### create/any

Creates a new asset specified by the format parameter.

### Parameters:

`pin` : Required if **locked**. The `PIN` to authorize the transaction.

`session` : Required by **argument** `-multiuser=1` to be supplied to identify the session. For single-user API mode the `session` should not be supplied.&#x20;

`name` : Optional for **noun** `name` as a _UTF-8_ encoded string that will generate a name object register that points to new object. If noun is `token` this will be created as a global name.

`format` : The format the caller is using to define the asset. Values can be `readonly`, `raw`, `basic` and `JSON`. If the noun is `raw or readonly` the format has to be the same as the noun.

`data` : Required for format type's `readonly` or `raw` and `any` noun, allows caller to add arbitrary data to object.

`data` : If noun and format is `raw or readonly`, then this field is used to specify the data values.

`<fieldname>=<value>` : If format is `basic`, then the caller can provide additional = pairs for each piece of data to store in the asset.

`json` : If format is `JSON`, then this field will hold the json definition of the asset as a JSON array of objects representing each field in the object. It uses the following format:

* `name` : The name of the data field.
* `type` : The data type to use for this field. Values can be `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `uint256`, `uint512`, `uint1024`, `string`, or `bytes`.
* `value` : The default value of the field.
* `mutable` : The boolean field to indicate whether the field is writable (true) or read-only (false).
* `maxlength`: Only applicable to `string` or `bytes` fields where `mutable`=true, this is the maximum number of characters (bytes) that can be stored in the field. If no maxlength parameter is provided then we will default the field size to the length of the default value rounded up to the nearest 64 bytes.

`name` : Optional name **identifying** the item to be transferred. This is optional if the address is provided.

`address` : Optional register address to **identify** the item to be transferred. This is optional if the name is provided.

`recipient` : Required to **identify** the profile to transfer the item to. This is optional if the username is provided.

`expires` : This optional field allows callers to specify an **expiration** for the transfer transaction. The expires value is the `number of seconds` from the transaction creation time after which the transaction can no longer be claimed by the recipient. Conversely, when you apply an expiration to a transaction, you are unable to void the transaction until after the expiration time. If expires is set to 0, the transaction will never expire, making the sender unable to ever void the transaction. If omitted, a default expiration of 7 days (604800 seconds) is applied.
