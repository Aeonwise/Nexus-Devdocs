# Brick and Mortar Stores

Nexus has been designed for the real world, everyday use by the average joe and can be understood in this use-case. This can be easily implemented by any brick and motor stores to manage the store by integrating Nexus.

Nexus can be used for payments, invoices, logistics and tracking, online marketplace.  To make it easy we need to understand how these things can be implemented.

What is the

The brick & motor stores will use the hybrid network feature, where they can accept payments from customers and use invoices for accepting payments and paying distributors on the public chain. \
While they can manage the stock and take care of logistics on the private chain.  This makes it easy as there are no fees involved on the private chain and also the data is private.

The store can even have an online marketplace powered by the P2P API, which is an on-chain

The store needs to have a new interface build on Nexus&#x20;

## What overheads the Store has?

The store owner will have to run nodes to maintain the hybrid network. The no of nodes will depend on the redundancy the database needs. Compared to existing systems the overheads are very low.&#x20;

If the store owner needs 3x redundancy, he needs to run 3 nodes which will be hosted on VPS or owned hardware or a mix of both.&#x20;

## What things can be implemented by Stores

Brick & motor stores can use one or all the options listed below:

### Payments:&#x20;

The Nexus Interface will have a Point of Sale (PoS) terminal module. This will make it very for customers to pay using the mobile wallet. The store can even integrate Nexus API into their existing system. With the Query DSL it is very easy to keep track of all the payments and generate reports.

### Invoices:

The store can issue invoices or accept invoices from distributors which will keep a track of all the payments done. This can be accessed using the Interface invoice module or integrating the Invoice API into existing system. Reports are built into the invoice API and can be further narrowed down using on-chain search powered by Query DSL.

### Inventory Tracking:

Nexus ha a supply API which can be used to track all the inventory and also track the location. This  data will be stored on the private side of the hybrid network which has no fees and is very fast. Each item will have its own QR code generated when minting as an item and the existing product bar codes can be integrated into the supply items as the unique identifier or name.

### Online Marketplace:

Brick & motor stores also can have an online marketplace presence with the upcoming P2P marketplace which can be used to exchange tokens and assets. Store owners need to  create their physical goods as assets and put it for sale with the location, Users can search assets available in their area using the location and they can buy it online and the store owner can use the public chain supply API to track the goods sent using&#x20;
