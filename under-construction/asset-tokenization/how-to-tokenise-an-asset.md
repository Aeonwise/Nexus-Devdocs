# How to Tokenise an Asset?

In Nexus the user can tokenize an asset using the Interface or via the Assets & Finance API. This guide will outline the process using the Interface, the process is the same using API's

For this guide we will tokenise a rental property. First we need to create an Asset which represents our rental property. For this we need some attributes of the rental property like name, owner, location, registration details, total area, GPS co-ordinates,&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
NXS payout sent to an asset will be distributed to the asset token holders as per the % of their holdings at that point of time. If any tokens are held in the originating contract then the  % of the payout which corresponds to the % of tokens held, will be credited back to the payout account when the debit contract expires.
{% endhint %}
