# Asset Tokenization

Asset tokenization is a new concept that uses digital tokens to fractionalize ownership of assets such as property, jewellery or fine art and smart contracts on blockchain to manage these ownership rights. Being able to tokenize assets opens up new alternative investment opportunities for asset managers and their clients, but today, the business and technology infrastructure is not in place to be able to manage tokenized assets within the portfolio management system.

On Nexus Asset tokenization is the process by which an issuer creates an "_**Asset**_ which represents a digital or physical asset, a fungible token and then link them together (Tokenizing). The tokens now represents that particular "_**Asset**_. &#x20;

Asset Tokenization makes it easy for anyone to create a fractional ownership of an asset. It also makes it easy to distribute the dividend or profits to the asset owners in percentage of their holdings automatically at that point of time.&#x20;

### Why Nexus for Asset Tokenization?

Nexus provides lot of benefits for any type of user who is looking to Tokenize an Asset. Firstly any user can tokenize an asset using the Nexus Wallet Interface and is abstracted from code or smart-contracts. It allows true peer-to-peer (P2P) asset creation and sale using the on-chain P2P Marketplace via the Marketplace module in the Interface. It is cheap to mint assets, tokens and free to transfer tokens. It also automatically payout profits or dividend to the asset token holders in proportion of the tokens held at that point of time.&#x20;

Suppose you have a property worth $500,000 in New York, NY. Asset tokenization could convert ownership of this property into 500,000 tokens — each one representing a tiny percentage (0.0002%) of the property. Let's say you need to borrow $50,000; it wouldn’t make sense to sell your property, because you need somewhere to live, but you still need the money. So instead,  issue tokens on a public distributed ledger which allows people to freely buy and sell on different exchanges. When someone buys a token, they buy 0.0002% of the ownership in the asset. 500,000 tokens to become 100% owner of the property. Since distributed ledger technologies are immutable, no one can erase the ownership of the investor who has bought the tokens, or in this matter, shares of a property.

NXS payout sent to an asset will be distributed to the asset token holders as per the % of their holdings at that point of time. If any tokens are held in the originating contract then the  % of the payout which corresponds to the % of tokens held, will be credited back to the payout account when the debit contract expires.

Nexus can transform many industries and the way investors interact with businesses and brokerage firms. This can enable the creation of borderless networks where investors, businesses, and communities can interact with each other without a central authority.



Tokenization is poised to become the next big thing in the financial markets because it provides the following benefits:

* **Liquidity** – By converting real-world assets to **Nexus** tokens, issuers can secure greater liquidity. For example, private securities are typically illiquid, which affects the trading process on secondary markets. Thanks to tokenization, this problem can be addressed to give investors more freedom to implement various strategies on scarcer assets.
* **Fractional ownership** – One of the most important features of tokenization is the ability to own fractions of an asset. For example, as an investor, you might be interested in getting exposure to the real estate market by owning property in the best region. However, you might not hold enough funds to buy a single property, let alone create a real estate portfolio. If every property would be converted into multiple tokens, you could own a portion of it or shares of multiple properties and thus benefit from their potential price gains. By holding a token or several of them, you hold the definitive proof that you are the owner of a share of that property.
* **Faster and free transactions** – Modern blockchains enable fast and low-cost transactions, and this relates to the tokenized assets as well. The algorithm ensures that the network has high throughput and low fees. This could speed up the adoption of tokenization as the main approach to deal with real-world assets.
* **Transparency** – Blockchain has become one of the most important technologies thanks to its unique attributes, including immutability and transparency. Once a blockchain transaction has achieved finality, it cannot be reversed, canceled, or tampered with in any way. The good news is that Algorand ensures that transaction finality is reached in less than 5 seconds. This allows all network participants to monitor data almost in real-time and be sure about the authenticity of transactions.&#x20;
* **Convenience** – Several decades ago, the main form of communication between investors, brokers, and market makers was done by phone. There were no online accounts and no advanced charting options right in your pocket. Today, everyone can get exposure to stocks by buying shares or speculate on their price via derivatives through online platforms. The internet has transformed the way we invest, but blockchain can do even more by making the investment process more convenient and accessible.

#### **What can be tokenized?**

The possibilities are endless as tokenization allows for both fractional ownership and proof-of-ownership. From traditional assets like venture capital funds, bonds, commodities, and real-estate properties to exotic assets like sports teams, race horses, artwork, and celebrities, companies worldwide use blockchain technology to tokenize almost anything. However, we have grouped them into four main categories:

**Asset:** An asset is any item of value that someone can transform into cash. It’s further divided into two classes: personal and business. Personal assets can include cashand property. Business assets include assets that are present on the balance sheet.

**Equity**: Equity (shares) can be tokenized; however, the assets remain in the digital form of security tokens stored online in a wallet. Investors can typically buy shares on a stock exchange.

**Funds:** An investment fund is a type of asset that investors can tokenize — these tokens represent an investors' share of the fund. Each investor is provided tokens which represent their share of the fund.

**Services:** A business can offer goods or services as a way to raise funds or conduct business. Investors can use tokens to purchase goods or services provided by the supplier.
