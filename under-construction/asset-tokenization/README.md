# Asset Tokenization

Asset tokenization is a new concept that uses digital tokens to fractionalize ownership of assets such as property, jewellery or fine art and smart contracts on blockchain to manage these ownership rights. Being able to tokenize assets opens up new alternative investment opportunities for asset managers and their clients, but today, the business and technology infrastructure is not in place to be able to manage tokenized assets within the portfolio management system.

On Nexus Asset tokenization is the process by which an issuer creates an "_**Asset**_ which represents a digital or physical asset, a fungible token and then link them together (Tokenizing). The tokens now represents that particular "_**Asset**_. &#x20;

Asset Tokenization makes it easy for anyone to create a fractional ownership of an asset. It also makes it easy to distribute the dividend or profits to the asset owners in percentage of their holdings automatically at that point of time. This makes it easy for people who do not have a lot of money to invest in owning a full asset.

### Why Nexus for Asset Tokenization?

Nexus Blockchain provides lot of benefits for every type of user who is looking to tokenize an Asset. Firstly any user can tokenize an asset using the Wallet Interface and is abstracted from code, writing smart-contracts or dealing with a third party tokenizing service. It allows true peer-to-peer (P2P) asset creation and sale using the on-chain P2P Marketplace module in the Interface. It is cheap to mint assets, tokens and free to transfer tokens. It also automatically pays out the profits or dividends to the asset token holders in proportion to the tokens held at that point of time.&#x20;

Nexus can transform many industries and the way investors interact with businesses and brokerage firms. This can enable the creation of borderless networks where investors, businesses, and communities can interact with each other without a central authority.



Tokenization is poised to become the next big thing in the financial markets because it provides the following benefits:

* **Liquidity** – By converting real-world assets to **Nexus** tokens, issuers can secure greater liquidity. For example, private securities are typically illiquid, which affects the trading process on secondary markets. Thanks to tokenization, this problem can be addressed to give investors more freedom to implement various strategies on scarcer assets.
* **Fractional ownership** – One of the most important features of tokenization is the ability to own fractions of an asset. For example, as an investor, you might be interested in getting exposure to the real estate market by owning property in the best region. However, you might not hold enough funds to buy a single property, let alone create a real estate portfolio. If every property would be converted into multiple tokens, you could own a portion of it or shares of multiple properties and thus benefit from their potential price gains. By holding a token or several of them, you hold the definitive proof that you are the owner of a share of that property.
* **Faster and free transactions** – Modern blockchains enable fast and low-cost transactions, and this relates to the tokenized assets as well. The algorithm ensures that the network has high throughput and low fees. This could speed up the adoption of tokenization as the main approach to deal with real-world assets.
* **Transparency** – Blockchain has become one of the most important technologies thanks to its unique attributes, including immutability and transparency. Once a blockchain transaction has achieved finality, it cannot be reversed, canceled, or tampered with in any way.&#x20;
* **Convenience** – Several decades ago, the main form of communication between investors, brokers, and market makers was done by phone. There were no online accounts and no advanced charting options right in your pocket. Today, everyone can get exposure to stocks by buying shares or speculate on their price via derivatives through online platforms. The internet has transformed the way we invest, but blockchain can do even more by making the investment process more convenient and accessible.

#### **What can be tokenized?**

The possibilities are endless as tokenization allows for both fractional ownership and proof-of-ownership. From traditional assets like venture capital funds, bonds, commodities, and real-estate properties to exotic assets like sports teams, race horses, artwork, and celebrities, companies worldwide use blockchain technology to tokenize almost anything. However, we have grouped them into four main categories:

**Asset:** An asset is any item of value that someone can transform into cash. It’s further divided into two classes: personal and business. Personal assets can include cashand property. Business assets include assets that are present on the balance sheet.

**Equity**: Equity (shares) can be tokenized; however, the assets remain in the digital form of security tokens stored online in a wallet. Investors can typically buy shares on a stock exchange.

**Funds:** An investment fund is a type of asset that investors can tokenize — these tokens represent an investors' share of the fund. Each investor is provided tokens which represent their share of the fund.

**Services:** A business can offer goods or services as a way to raise funds or conduct business. Investors can use tokens to purchase goods or services provided by the supplier.
