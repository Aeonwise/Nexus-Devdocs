# Assets - NFT's

### **What is an Asset (NFT)?**

Assets, commonly known as NFT's stand for non-fungible token. Assets are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us digitally represent things like art, collectibles, even real estate and a lot of other things. They can only have one official owner (sigchain) at a time and they're secured by the Nexus blockchain â€“ no one can modify the record of ownership.

An Asset can only have one owner (user account / sigchain) at a time. Ownership is managed through the uniqueID (Asset Name) and metadata that no other token can replicate. Assets are minted and are assigned ownership to the particular user account (Sigchain).&#x20;

NFT's can be transferred to other users which transfers the ownership of the Asset to that particular user. Assets provide the use of mutable metadata like the "_Owner Field"_ for a house which is minted as an asset. The new owner then can change the Owner field to reflect his name as the owner of the house.
