### Traditional Gaming <a href="#why-does-gaming-need-blockchain" id="why-does-gaming-need-blockchain"></a>

In traditional games, you buy the game – you play it. As you play, you find and discover weapons, gear, and other items within the game. Then you use this equipment to fight, defend yourself, etc. What happens when you stop playing the game?

You no longer need those items or weapons you found or purchased. All the work and time you put into the game, the assets you have are now meaningless. You can’t use them in another game, and you can’t sell them either because they are not your property.

### Blockchain games?

On a high level, they work similarly to traditional games. You play, find and discover items, weapons, and gear and use or equip those items while playing the game. However, the key difference with their traditional counterparts is that the assets exist outside of the game.

When you turn off the game or stop playing altogether, you can use the items, for example, a sword or a shield, in another game, sell them on an external market or convert them into cryptocurrency. Blockchain makes each item unique and transferrable.

Blockchain allows you to create items and store their information. For example, the requirements might be to create an item, name it, have a picture to go along with that item, define the quantity and the ownership of these items. It would look similar to this:

* Golden shield
* Picture of the shield
* Quantity – 100
* Owner – the game creator, deciding on who will get them.

Then the creator of the asset submits this data to the blockchain.  Now, since this blockchain asset exists and we know that there are 100 golden shields, the person who holds them can give these assets away by transferring them on the blockchain.

For example, you want to send this shield to a gamer named Aeon4586, who won it in a giveaway competition. You transfer it to that gamer, and it is then stored in his Signature chain. Now, it is recorded on the blockchain that Aeon4586 is one of the 100 owners of the golden shield. You can verify this by checking the asset name or register address to see the asset details.

* A player officially and provably owns assets.
* Blockchain records this information for everyone to see.
* Games check the blockchain to see what assets a person owns.
* Blockchain game developers decide whether to include this item in their game.
* To create this asset, a player doesn’t need to have any game to be developed beforehand.
* Blockchain games become a multiverse, where gamers can use assets across different games, sell them at auctions, and put them on a marketplace outside the game.
* Players are free to send their items peer to peer.

### Advantages of Blockchain Games

* A player officially and provably owns game assets.
* The Asset information is recorded on the blockchain for everyone to see.
* Games will check the blockchain to see what assets a player owns.
* Blockchain game developers decide whether to include this item in their game.
* Blockchain games become a multiverse, where gamers can use assets across different games, sell them at auctions, and put them on a marketplace outside the game.
* Players are free to send or sell their items peer to peer.
* The time a player spends in a game to own in-game assets will not be a total waste and can be monetized.
