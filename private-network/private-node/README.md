# Private Node

### **What are Private Blockchains?**

A private blockchain is a permissioned blockchain. Private blockchains function based on access restrictions that limit individuals who may interact in the network.

In other words, it is a permissioned and restrictive blockchain that operates in a closed network. These are used mainly within an organization where only particular members are participants of a Blockchain network. These are best suited for enterprises and businesses that want to use Blockchain only for internal uses. The best part is that no one can enter this type of network without proper authentication**.**
