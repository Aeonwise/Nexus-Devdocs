### **What are Private Blockchains?**

A private blockchain is a permissioned blockchain. Private blockchains function based on access restrictions that limit individuals who may interact in the network.

In other words, it is a permissioned and restrictive blockchain that operates in a closed network. These are used mainly within an organization where only particular members are participants of the blockchain network. These are best suited for enterprises and businesses that want to use blockchain only for internal uses, this also helps to keep their sensitive data in their control. The best part is that no one can access this type of network without proper authentication**.**

Even though the core is the same that powers the public network, it can be configured to run as Hybrid network or private network. Enterprises or organisations get an open source blockchain at no extra cost. They also get the benefit of regular updates and a big community which tests the software at a very large scale.
