# SYSTEM

The System API provides public access to information about this node. This includes data such as the version of software the node is running, ledger and mempool state, node IP address, and connected peers.

## `Direct Endpoints`

The following commands are direct endpoints and thus do not support the above `verb` and `noun` structure available above.

[`stop`](system.md#stop)\
[`get/info`](system.md#get-info)\
[`get/metrics`](system.md#get-metrics)\
[`list/peers`](system.md#list-peers)\
[`list/lisp-eids`](system.md#list-lisp-eids)\
[`validate/address`](system.md#validate-address)``

Direct endpoints support filters and operators.

## `stop`

Initiate node shutdown sequence.

```
system/stop
```

### Parameters:

`password`: Optional to **authenticate** before initiating core shutdown. This password is the one provided in the configuration file which will help prevent accidental remote shutdown.

{% hint style="info" %}
**NOTE:**

The shutdown authentication password has to be provided in the configuration file with the flag `system/stop=<password>`
{% endhint %}

### Results:

#### Return value JSON object:

```
"Nexus server stopping"
[Completed in 0.039270 ms]
```

## `get/info`

Returns a summary of information about this node

```
system/get/metrics
```

### Parameters:
